You (or someone else) entered this email address when trying to reset the
password of a @Html.Raw(Model.SiteName) account.
@if (Model.ErrorReason == MvcAccount.ResetPasswordErrorReason.AccountDisabled) {
<text>
However, the account is currently disabled and therefore a password reset is 
not allowed.
</text>} else {
<text>
However, this email address is not on our database of registered users and
therefore the attempted password reset has failed.

If you were expecting this email, please try again using the email address you 
gave when opening your account.
</text>}
   
If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your username or email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. 
If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action 
and can safely disregard this email.
